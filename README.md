# Project-Insight

## Overview
Project-Insight is a versatile React application designed for mobile platforms through React Native. It focuses on the educational visualization of common search algorithms, providing an interactive platform for both learning and teaching complex algorithmic concepts. The core feature of Project-Insight is its dual-component interface: one part dedicated to a JavaScript (JS) compiler for live coding, and the other to a dynamic visualization tool.

### Key Features

- **Interactive JS Compiler**: Enables users to write and test their own implementations of search algorithms directly within the app. This feature supports a hands-on learning experience, allowing users to experiment with code and immediately see the results of their work.

- **Algorithm Visualization**: Utilizes Mermaid code blocks to graphically represent the structure of nodes within search trees, A*, Monte Carlo algorithms, and more. This visual aid is designed to help users better understand the flow and efficiency of different algorithms.

- **Markdown Support**: Generates and renders markdown files for each algorithm's visualization, enhancing the educational utility by allowing users to take notes and export their findings and insights.

- **Exporting Capability**: Offers functionality to export the visualized node structures and personal notes, making it easy for users to share their work and insights with others or save for future reference.
